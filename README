HOW TO RUN:

1) rake db:setup
2) rails s
3) You'll find the Admin email/password in the db/seeds.rb file

Data/Relationship model:
Admin: name, standard devise fields
User: name
Item: name
Category: name

Admin can log in (see below)
User can purchase many Items
Items can be purchased by many users
Items have many categories

1. Using Devise gem (or another authentication gem you're more familiar with), create simple ability for admin to log in
2. Once logged in, admin can see a table that contains all users and their items purchased. 
Item categories are listed by each item.
TABLE COLUMNS:
User's name, Item purchased name, Item's category names

3. Clicking on a user's name will bring up a page showing:
User name, items purchased (with associated categories),  recommended items (in order of relevance)

Recommended items are defined as:
Based on the purchased items, recommend items that most closely related based on the category similarity.
Must have at least 1 category in common. Must not have already been purchased by the user.

Example:
Item 1 is "Nike Dunks" with categories "Shoes", "Basketball", and "Nike"
Item 2 is "Nike Street Basketball" with categories "Balls", "Basketball" and "Nike"
Item 3 is "Addidas Jersey" with categories "Clothing", "Basketball", and "Addidas"
Item 4 is "Golf bag" with categories "Golf", "Accessories"

If user purchased item1, then they should be recommended [item 2, item 3] 
(Note: item 2 is higher precedence because it has 2 matching categories)
